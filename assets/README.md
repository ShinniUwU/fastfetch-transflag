# Assets Folder

This folder contains visual assets to demonstrate how the Fastfetch configuration looks when applied. You can find preview images here that showcase the expected output of the configuration settings provided in this repository.

## Contents

- `fastfetch_preview.png`: A screenshot showing how Fastfetch displays system information with the provided configuration.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is solely to provide a visual reference. The images help users see what the final output should look like once they have set up Fastfetch according to the instructions in the main README.

## Deletion

If you find the `assets` folder included in your Fastfetch config folder (e.g., `~/.config/fastfetch/assets`), you can safely delete it. The images are not required for the functionality of Fastfetch and are included here for demonstration purposes only.

## Note

Ensure that your Fastfetch configuration points to the correct logo path in your system. For example:

```json
"logo": "~/.config/fastfetch/Logo/trans_arch.png"
